#    CAESAR CIPHER - PART 2
#    Handling capitals and non-alphanumeric
#
#    This cipher varies from Part I in the alphabet variable now contains
#    capital letters and non-alphanumeric characters
#
#    There are still two major issues with this version of the cipher, can
#    you think what they are?
